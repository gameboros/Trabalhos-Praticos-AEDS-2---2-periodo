# Trabalhos-Praticos-AEDS-2---2-periodo

These folders contain code made during my second semester of college wich I am currently enrolled in. It focuses on fully creating a data parser for a specific preset
database, then sorting the data through different sorting algorithms.

The folder "enunciado" contains info(in portuguese) about what we must achieve with each question.
The folder "filmes" contains HTML pages of different movies of a movie database - the one we are using in the project.
The folder "TP01" , "TP02" , "TP03" , "TP04" contains the code respective to all questions inside the "enunciado" folder.
